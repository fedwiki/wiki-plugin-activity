# Federated Wiki - Activity Plugin

The Activity plugin lists pages in your neighborhood. It expands as your neighborhood grows.
Page names used on multiple sites are grouped together, with the most current site on the right.

The client source code is in `src/activity.js`, tests in `test/test.js`

Running `npm run build` will use `scripts/build-client.js` to build the client `client/activity.js`
together with a map file.
